# Kindergarten-Line-Algorithm
The Kindergarten Line problem is as follows; a bunch of elementary age kids are standing in a line. The teacher tells the kids to turn to their left. As the kids are young they do not know their left from their right; thus, the kids turn in random directions. Does the line ever reach a stable state?

This python script creates an array of random boolean values (0's and 1's) and applies the Kindergarten Line Algorithm to the array to evaluate the stability of the line structure.
